"""A standardized buffering implementation for file-based backends.

This module defines a variant of the buffering protocol in
:py:mod:`file_buffered_collection`. This module exploits the same idea that
all file-based backends can use a similar buffering protocol using integrity
checks based on file modification times. However, that buffering approach
mitigates I/O costs by serializing data into a single buffer that is then
treated as the underlying data store by associated :class:`SyncedCollection` objects.
That approach is expensive because it still requires constant encoding and
decoding of data while checking for changes to the data in the buffer from other
instances pointing to the same underlying files. The approach in this module circumvents
this these performance bottlenecks by directly sharing the underlying data store
in the buffer for all objects, completely removing the need for encoding, decoding,
and updating in place.

class SharedMemoryFileBufferedCollection(BufferedCollection):
    """A :class:`SyncedCollection` that defers all I/O when buffered.

    This class implements a variant of the buffering strategy defined in the
    :class:`signac.core.synced_collections.file_buffered_collection.FileBufferedCollection`.
    Like that class, this class enables buffering for file-based backends by storing
    the last known modification time of the data on disk prior to entering buffered
    mode, then checking whether that has changed when the buffer is flushed.
    The buffering implemented by
    :class:`~.FileBufferedCollection`
    is true buffering in the sense that the entire write operation is
    performed as normal, including serialization, except that data is written to
    a different persistent store than the underlying resource. However, such
    buffering incurs significant overhead associated all the non-I/O tasks
    required prior to writing to the buffer, particularly data serialization.
    This class exists to remove these performance bottlenecks, which can be
    severe, and provide a more performant alternative.

    The buffering method implemented in this class circumvents the
    aforementioned performance bottlenecks by directly sharing the data between
    multiple synced collections. Rather than encoding and decoding data, all
    objects associated with a file share a single underlying in-memory data store,
    allowing any changes to one to be transparently persisted to the others. When
    the first collection associated with a particular file is accessed or
    modified in buffered mode for the first time, its data is stored in a cache.
    When future collections pointing to the same file access the cache, rather
    than synchronizing their data with the contents of the cache, the underlying
    data attribute of the collection is simply repointed at the data in the cache.
    This method exploits the fact that all mutable collection types in Python are
    references, so modifying one such collection results in modifying all of them,
    thereby removing any need for more complicated synchronization protocols.

    This approach has one principal downside relative to the other buffering
    method. Since the data is not always encoded into a byte-string, the exact
    size of the data in the buffer is not exactly known. This method simply counts
    the number of objects in the buffer as a means to decide how much to store before
    the buffer is flushed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str, optional
        The filename of the associated JSON file on disk (Default value = None).

    .. note::
        Important note for subclasses: This class should be inherited before
        any other collections. This requirement is due to the extensive use of
        multiple inheritance: since this class is designed to be combined with
        other :class:`SyncedCollection` types without making those types aware
        of buffering behavior, it transparently hooks into the initialization
        process, but this is dependent on its constructor being called before
        those of other classes.

    Warnings
    --------
    Although it can be done safely, in general modifying two different collections
    pointing to the same underlying resource while both are in different buffering
    modes is unsupported and can lead to undefined behavior. This class makes a
    best effort at performing safe modifications, but it is possible to construct
    nested buffered contexts for different objects that can lead to an invalid
    buffer state, or even situations where there is no obvious indicator of what
    is the canonical source of truth. In general, if you need multiple objects
    pointing to the same resource, it is **strongly** recommeneded to work with
    both of them in identical buffering states at all times.

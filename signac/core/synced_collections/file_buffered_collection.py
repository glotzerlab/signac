"""Implement the FileBufferedSyncedCollection class.

The FileBufferedSyncedCollection is a concrete implementation of the buffer
protocol established by the BufferedSyncedCollection class. It uses an
in-memory cache to store data when in buffered mode. It is suitable for
use with any file-based backend because it performs integrity checks based on
whether or not the underlying file has been modified while buffering was
activated.

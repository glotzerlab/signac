class SyncedCollection(Collection):
    """An abstract :class:`Collection` type that is synced with a backend.

    This class extends :py:class:`collections.abc.Collection` and adds a number of abstract
    internal methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. These methods can be
    split into two groups of functions that are designed to be implemented by
    separate subtrees in the inheritance hierarchy that can then be composed:

        **Concrete Collection Types**

        These subclasses should implement the APIs for specific types of
        collections. For instance, a list-like :class:`SyncedCollection`
        should implement the standard methods for sequences. In addition, they
        must implement the following abstract methods defined by the
        :class:`SyncedCollection`:

        - :meth:`~.is_base_type`: Determines whether an object satisfies the
          semantics of the collection object a given :class:`SyncedCollection`
          is designed to mimic.
        - :meth:`~._to_base`: Converts a :class:`SyncedCollection` to its
          natural base type (e.g. a `list`).
        - :meth:`~._update`: Updates the :class:`SyncedCollection` to match the
          contents of the provided :py:class:`collections.abc.Collection`.
          After calling ``sc._update(c)``, we must have that ``sc == c``; however,
          since such updates are frequent when loading and saving data to a
          resource, :meth:`_update` should be implemented to minimize new object
          creation wherever possible.

        **Backend**

        These subclasses encode the process by which in-memory data is
        converted into a representation suitable for a particular backend. For
        instance, a JSON backend should know how to save a Python object into a
        JSON-encoded file and then read that object back.

        - :meth:`~._load_from_resource`: Loads data from the underlying
          resource and returns it in an object satisfying :meth:`~.is_base_type`.
        - :meth:`~._save_to_resource`: Stores data to the underlying resource.
        - :attr:`~._backend`: A unique string identifier for the resource backend.

    Since these functionalities are effectively completely orthogonal, members of
    a given group should be interchangeable. For instance, a dict-like SyncedCollection
    can be combined equally easily with JSON, MongoDB, or SQL backends.

    To fully support the restrictions and requirements of particular backends,
    arbitrary validators may be added to different subclasses. Validators are
    callables that accept different data types as input and raise Exceptions if the
    data does not conform to the requirements of a particular backend. For
    example, a JSON validator would raise Exceptions if it detected non-string
    keys in a dict. Validators should have no side effects.

    Parameters

    parent : SyncedCollection, optional
        If provided, the collection within which this collection is nested
        (Default value = None).

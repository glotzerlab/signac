"""Implement the BufferedCollection class.

The BufferedCollection extends the abstract SyncedCollection to support
transparent buffering of the synchronization process. This feature allows
client code to indicate to the collection when it is safe to buffer reads and
writes, which usually means guaranteeing that the synchronization destination
(e.g. an underlying file or database entry) will not be modified by other
processes concurrently with the set of operations within the buffered block.
Judicious use of buffering can dramatically speed up code paths that might
otherwise involve, for instance, heavy I/O. The specific buffering mechanism
must be implemented by each backend since it depends on the nature of the
underlying data format.

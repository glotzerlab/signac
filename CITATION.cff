abstract: |
    The signac framework helps users manage and scale file-based workflows, facilitating data
    reuse, sharing, and reproducibility. It provides a simple and robust data model to create
    a well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata. This makes it easier to
    operate on large data spaces, streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data
    collectively accessible.

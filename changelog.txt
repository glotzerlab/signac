[1.0.0] -- 2019-02-28
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - Official support for Python 3.7.
 - The ``H5Store`` and ``H5StoreManager`` classes, which are useful for storing (numerical) array-like data with an HDF5-backend. These classes are exposed within the root namespace.
 - The ``job.data`` and ``project.data`` properties which present an instance of ``H5Store`` to access numerical data within the job workspace and project root directory.
 - The ``job.stores`` and ``project.stores`` properties, which present an instance of ``H5StoreManager`` to manage multiple instances of ``H5Store`` to store numerical array-like data within the project workspace and project root directory.
 - The ``signac.get_job()`` and the ``signac.Project.get_job()`` functions that allow users to get a job handle by switching into or providing the job's workspace directory.
 - The ``job`` variable is automatically set when opening a ``signac shell`` from within a job's workspace directory.
 - Add the ``signac shell -c`` option which allows the direct specification of Python commands to be executed within the shell.
 - Automatic cast of ``numpy`` arrays to lists when storing them within a ``JSONDict``, e.g., a ``job.statepoint`` or ``job.document``.
 - Enable ``Collection`` class to manage collections stored in compressed files (gzip, zip, etc.).
 - Enable deleting of ``JSONDict`` keys through the attribute interface, e.g., ``del job.doc.foo``.
 - Pretty HTML representation of instances of ``Project`` and ``JobsCursor`` targeted at Jupyter Notebooks (requires pandas, automatically enabled when installed).
 - The ``to_dataframe()`` function to export the job state point and document data of a ``Project`` or a ``JobsCursor``, e.g., the result of ``Project.find_jobs()``, as a ``pandas.Dataframe`` (requires pandas).

Changed
+++++++

 - Dots (`.`) in keys are no longer allowed for ``JSONDict`` and ``Collection`` keys (previously deprecated).
 - The ``JSONDict`` module is exposed in the root namespace, which is useful for storing text-serializable data  with a JSON-backend similar to the ``job.statepoint`` or ``job.document``, etc.
 - The ``Job.init()`` method returns the job to allow one-line job creation and initialization.
 - The ``search`` argument was added to the ``signac.get_project()`` function, which when True (the default), will cause signac to search for a project within *and above* a specified root directory, not only within the root directory. The behavior without any arguments remains unchanged.

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix ``Collection.update()`` behavior such that existing documents with identical primary key are updated. Previously, a ``KeyError`` would be raised.
 - Fix issue where the ``Job.move()`` would trigger a confusing ``DestinationExists`` exception when trying to move jobs across devices / file systems.
 - Fix issue that caused failures when the ``python-rapidjson`` package is installed. The ``python-rapidjson`` package is used as the primary JSON-backend when installed.
 - Fix issue where schema with multiple keys would subset incorrectly if the list of jobs or statepoints was provided as an iterator rather than a sequence.

Removed
+++++++

 - Removes the obsolete and deprecated ``core.search_engine`` module.
 - The previously deprecated ``Project.find_statepoints()`` and ``Project.find_job_documents()`` functions have been removed.
 - The ``Project.find_jobs()`` no longer accepts the obsolete ``index`` argument.


Version 0.9
===========

[0.9.5] -- 2019-01-31
---------------------

Fixed
+++++

 - Ensure that the next() function can be called for a JobsIterator, e.g., `project.find()`.
 - Pickling issue that occurs when a _SyncedDict (job.statepoint, job.document, etc.) contains a list.
 - Issue with the readline module that would cause signac shell to fail on Windows operating systems.


[0.9.4] -- 2018-10-24
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - Adds the ``$ signac import`` command and the ``Project.import_from()`` method for the import of data spaces into a project workspace, such as a directory, a tarball, or a zip file.
 - Adds the ``$ signac export`` command and the ``Project.export_to()`` method for the export of project workspaces to an external location, such as a directory, a tarball, or a zip file.
 - Adds functionality for the rapid initialization of temporary projects with the ``signac.TemporaryProject`` context manager.
 - Adds the ``signac.Project.temporary_project()`` context manager which creates a temporary project within the root project workspace.
 - Add ``signac`` to the default namespace when invoking ``signac shell``.
 - Add option to specify a custom view path for the ``signac view``/ ``Project.create_linked_view()`` function.
 - Iterables of documents used to construct a Collection no longer require an ``_id`` field.

Changed
+++++++

 - The default path for linked views has been adjusted to match the one used for data exports.

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix issue where differently typed integer values stored within a Collection under the same key would not be indexed correctly. This issue affected the correct function of the `$type` operator for aforementioned cases and would lead to incorrect types in the Project schema detection algorithm for integer values.
 - Fix issue where jobs that are migrated (state point change), but are not initialized, were not properly updated.
 - Fix issue where changes to lists as part of synchronized dictionary, for example a state point or document would not be saved.
 - Fix non-deterministic issue occuring on network file systems when trying to open jobs where the user has no write access to the job workspace directory.

[0.9.3] -- 2018-06-14
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - Add `$near` operator to express queries for numerical values that match up to a certain precision.
 - Add the `$ signac shell` sub command to directly launch a Python interpreter within a project directory.

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix issue where a job instance would not be properly updated after more than one state point reset.

[0.9.2] -- 2017-12-18
---------------------

Added
+++++

  - Add provisional feature (persistent state point caching); calling the ``Project.update_cache()`` method will generate and store a persistent state point cache in the project root directory, which will increase the speed of many project iteration, search, and selection operations.
  - Add ``Project.check()`` method which checks for workspace corruption, but does not make any attempt to repair it.
  - The ``Project.repair()`` method will attempt to repair jobs, that have been corrupted by manually renaming the job's workspace directory.

Changed
+++++++

  - Enable the *write_concern* flag for the ``job.document``.
  - Allow to omit the specification of an authentication mechanism in the MongoDB host configuration.

Fixed
+++++

  - Fix critical issue in the ``JSONDict`` implementation that would previously overwrite the underlying file when attempting to store values that are not JSON serializable.
  - Fix issue where the ``Project.export()`` function would ignore the update argument when the index to export to would be a MongoDB collection.

[0.9.1] -- 2017-11-07
---------------------

Fixed
+++++

  - Fix critical issue in the ``SyncedAttrDict`` implementation that would previously overwrite the underlying file if the first operation was a ``__setitem__()`` operation.

[0.9.0] -- 2017-10-28
---------------------

Added
+++++

  - Introduction of ``$ signac sync``, ``Project.sync()``, and ``Job.sync()`` for the simplified and fine-grained synchronization of multiple project data spaces.
  - Introduction of ``$ signac schema`` and ``Project.detect_schema()`` for the automatic detection of the implicit and semi-structured state point schema of a project data space.
  - Simplified aggregation of jobs over projects and ``Project.find_jobs()`` results with the ``Project.groupby()`` function.
  - Support for project-centralized data with the ``Project.document`` attribute and the ``Project.fn()`` method for the wrapping of filenames within the project root directory.
  - Added the ``Job.clear()`` and the ``Job.reset()`` methods to clear or reset a job's workspace data.

Changed
+++++++

  - Both ``Job.statepoint`` and ``Job.document`` now use the same underlying data structure and provide the exact same API (copy with ``()`` and access of keys as attributes).
  - The ``Collection`` class uses an internal counter instead of UUIDs for the generation of primary keys (resulting in improved performance).
  - Major performance improvements (faster Collection, improved caching)
  - Overhaul of the reference documentation.

Version 0.8
===========

[0.8.7] -- 2017-10-05
---------------------

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix an issue where the creation of linked views was non-deterministic in some cases.

[0.8.6] -- 2017-08-25
---------------------

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix Collection append truncation issue (see issue #66).

[0.8.5] -- 2017-06-07
---------------------

Changed
+++++++

 - The signac ids in the `signac find --show` view are no longer enclosed by quotation marks.

Fixed
+++++

 - Fix compatibility issue that broke the `signac find --view` and all `--pretty` commands on Python 2.7.
 - Fix issue where view directories would be incomplete in combination with heterogeneous state point schemas.

[0.8.4] -- 2017-05-19
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - All search queries on project and collection objects support various operators including: *$and*, *$or*, *$gt*, *$gte*, *$lt*, *$lte*, *$eq*, *$ne*, *$exists*, *$regex*, *$where*, *$in*, *$nin*, and *$type*.
 - The ``$ signac find`` command supports a simple filter syntax, where key value pairs can be provided as individual arguments.
 - The ``$ signac find`` command is extended by a *--show* option, to display the state point and the document contents directly. The contents are truncated to an adjustable depth to reduce output noise.
 - The ``$ signac view`` command has an additional filter option to select a sub data space directly without needing to pipe job ids.
 - The new ``$ signac document`` command can be used to display a job's document directly.

Changed
+++++++

 - Minor performance improvements.

[0.8.3] -- 2017-05-10
---------------------

Changed
+++++++

 - Raise ``ExportError`` when updating with an empty index.

Fixed
+++++

[0.8.1] -- 2017-04-17
---------------------

Fixed
+++++

 - Fixes wide-spread typo (*indeces* -> *indexes*).

[0.8.0] -- 2017-04-16
---------------------

Overall major simplification of the generation of indexes and the management and searching of index collections without external database.

Added
+++++

 - Introduction of the ``Collection`` class for the management of document collections, such as indexes in memory and on disk.
 - Generation of file indexes directly via the ``signac.index_files()`` function.
 - Generation of master indexes directly via the ``signac.index()`` function and the ``$ signac index`` command.
 - The API of ``signac_access.py`` files has been simplified, including the possibility to use a blank file for a minimal configuration.
 - Use the ``$ signac project --access`` command to create a minimal access module in addition to ``Project.create_access_module()``.
 - The update of existing index collections has been simplified by using the ``export()`` function with the `update=True` argument, which means that stale documents (the associated file or state point no longer exists) are automatically identified and removed.
 - Added the ``Job.ws`` attribute, as short-cut for ``Job.workspace()``.
 - The ``Job.sp`` interface has a ``get()`` function which can be used to specify a default value in case that the requested key is not part of the state point.

Changed (breaking API)
++++++++++++++++++++++

 - The ``$ signac index`` command generates a master index instead of a project index. To generate a project index from the command line use ``$ signac project --index`` instead.
 - The ``SignacProjectCrawler`` class expects the project's root directory as first argument, not the workspace directory.
 - The ``get_crawlers()`` function defined within a ``signac_access.py`` access module is expected to yield crawler instances directly, not a mapping of crawler ids and instances.
 - The simplification of the ``signac_access.py`` module API is reflected in a reduction of arguments to the ``Project.create_access_module()`` method.

Changed (non-breaking)
++++++++++++++++++++++

 - The ``RegexFileCrawler``, ``SignacProjectCrawler`` and ``MasterCrawler`` classes were moved into the root namespace.
 - If a ``MasterCrawler`` object is instantiated with the ``raise_on_error`` argument set to True, any errors encountered during crawling are raised instead of ignored and skipped; this simplifies the debugging of erroneous access modules.
 - Improved error message for invalid configuration files.
 - Better error messages for invalid ``$ signac find`` queries.
 - Check a host configuration on the command line via ``$ signac host --test``.
 - A MongoDB database host configuration defaults to *none* when no authentication method is explicitly specified.
 - Using the ``--debug`` option in combination with ``$ signac index`` will show the traceback of errors encountered during indexing instead of ignoring them.
 - Instances of ``Job`` are hashable, making it possible to use them as dict keys for instance.
 - The representation of ``Job`` instances via ``repr()`` can actually serves as copy constructor command.
 - The project interface implementation performs all non-trivial search operations on an internally management index collection, which improves performance and simplifies the code base.

Deprecated
++++++++++

 - The ``DocumentSearchEngine`` class has been deprecated, its functionality is now provided by the ``Collection`` class.

Fixed
+++++

 - An issue related to exporting documents to MongoDB collections via pymongo in combination with Python 2.7 has been fixed.

 - The ``Project.open_job()`` method accepts abbreviated job ids.
 - Add ``Project.min_len_unique_id()`` method to determine the minimum length of job ids to be unique within the project's data space.
 - Add ``Job.move()`` method to move jobs between projects.
 - Add ``Project.clone()`` method to copy jobs between projects.
 - Add ``$ signac move`` and ``$ signac clone`` command line functions.

 - Add cite module for the auto-generation of formatted references and BibTeX entries.

Removed
+++++++

 - Remove SSL authentication support.

[0.6.1] -- 2017-11-26
---------------------

Changed
+++++++

 - The ``Project.create_view()`` method triggers a ``DeprecationWarning`` instead of a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``.
 - The ``Project.find_variable_parameters()`` method triggers a ``DeprecationWarning`` instead of a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``.

Fixed
+++++

 - Make package more robust against PySide import errors.

 - Fix issue in ``indexing.fetch()`` previously resulting in local paths being ignored.
 - Fix error ``signac.__all__`` namespace directive.

[0.6.0] -- 2016-11-18
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - Add the ``export_to_mirror()`` function for mirroring files.
 - Introduction of the ``signac.fs`` namespace to simplify the configuration of mirror filesystems.
 - Add *errors* module to root namespace. Many exceptions raised inherit from the base exception types defined within that module, making it easier to catch signac related errors.
 - Add the ``export_one()`` function for the export of a single index document; simplifies the implementation of custom export functions.
 - Opening an instance of ``Job`` with the ``open_job()`` method multiple times and entering a job context recursively is now well-defined behavior: Opening a job now adds the current working directory onto a stack, closing it switches into the directory on top of the stack.
 - The return type of ``Project.open_job()`` can be configured to make it easier to specialize projects with custom job types.

Changed
+++++++

 - The MasterCrawler logic has been simplified; their primary function is the compilation of index documents from slave crawlers, all export logic, including data mirroring is now provided by the ``signac.export()`` function.
 - Each index document is now uniquely coupled with only one file or data object, which is why ``signac.fetch()`` replaces ``signac.fetch_one()`` and the latter one has been deprecated and is currently an alias of the former one.
 - The ``signac.fetch()`` function always returns a file-like object, regardless of format definition.
 - The format argument in the crawler ``define()`` function is now optional and has now very well defined behavior for str types. It is encouraged to define a format with a str constant rather than a file-like object type.
 - The ``TextFile`` file-like object class definition in the formats module has been replaced with a constant of type ``str``.
 - The ``signac.export()`` function automatically delegates to specialized implementations such as ``export_pymongo()`` and is more robust against errors, such as broken connections.
 - The ``export_pymongo()`` function makes multiple automatic restart attempts when encountering errors.
 - Documentation: The tutorial is now based on signac-examples jupyter notebooks.
 - The ``contrib.crawler`` module has been renamed to contrib.indexing to better reflect the semantic context.
 - The ``signac.export()`` function now implements the logic for data linking and mirroring.
 - Provide default argument for '--indent' option for ``$ signac statepoint`` command.
 - Log, but do not reraise exceptions during ``MasterCrawler`` execution, making the compilation of master indexes more robust against errors.
 - The object representation of ``Job`` and ``Project`` instances is simplified.
 - The warning verbosity has been reduced when importing modules with optional dependencies.

Removed
+++++++

 - All modules related to the stale *conversion framework* feature have been removed resulting in a removal of the optional networkx dependency.
 - Multiple modules related to the *conversion framework* feature have been removed, including: ``contrib.formats_network``, ``contrib.conversion``, and ``contrib.adapters``.

Fixed
+++++

 - Opening instances of ``Job`` with the ``Job.open()`` method multiple times, equivalently entering the job context recursively, does not cause an error anymore, but instead the behavior is well-defined.

---------------------

Added
+++++

 - New function: ``signac.init_project()`` simplifies project initialization within Python

Version 0.4
===========

[0.4.0] -- 2016-08-05
---------------------

Added
+++++

 - The performance of find operations can be greatly improved by using pre-generated job indexes.

 - New method: ``Project.create_linked_view()``
 - New method: ``Project.build_job_statepoint_index()``
 - New method: ``Project.build_job_search_index()``
 - The ``Project.find_jobs()`` method allows to filter by job document.

Changed
+++++++

 - The ``SignacProjectCrawler`` indexes all jobs, not only those with non-empty job documents.
 - The ``signac.fetch_one()`` function returns ``None`` if no associated object can be fetched.
 - The tutorial is restructured into multiple parts.
 - Instructions for installation are separated from the guide.

 - ``export()`` and ``export_pymongo()`` expect the index documents as first argument, not a crawler instance. The old API is still supported, but will trigger a DeprecationWarning.

The [**signac** framework](https://signac.io) helps users manage and scale file-based workflows, facilitating data reuse, sharing, and reproducibility.

It provides a simple and robust data model to create a well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata.
This makes it easier to operate on large data spaces, streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data collectively accessible.
